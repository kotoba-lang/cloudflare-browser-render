  "Cloudflare Browser Render (cfbr0w53) appview frontend shell.

  Migrated from the SvelteKit scaffold at
  appview/etzhayyim-wasm-cloudflare-browser-render-cfbr0w53/svelte to
  reagent + re-frame, rendered with `jp-go-dds.core` (デジタル庁デザイン
  システム) hiccup. The source had one `.svelte` file with real content —
  `src/routes/+page.svelte` — plus `src/app.html` as the SvelteKit shell
  template. `+page.svelte` rendered a single static facts page about this
  app surface (title/project/name/kind/routeCount/routes/vars/xrpc/
  relativePath, all hard-coded in its `<script>` block — no data fetch, no
  interactivity). Ported here one-to-one:

  - the `app` map literal becomes re-frame app-db data (`default-db` below)
    instead of a markup literal, so there is real event/sub logic to test
  - the five `<section>`s (top / facts / routes panel / vars panel / source
    panel) become the five view fns below, composed in `home-page`
  - `src/app.html`'s `%sveltekit.head%`/`%sveltekit.body%` template slots
    have no analogue here — this workspace is single-page-app-only
    (ADR-2608080100): one document, one bundle, one mount, so there is no
    second template to port, only `public/index.html`'s static shell.

  `public/index.html`'s inlined <style> was produced the same way
  okaimono's was (see that repo's cljs/src/okaimono/app.cljs docstring for
  the full regeneration recipe) — `jp-go-dds.page/->page` on the JVM,
  concatenating the vendored `dds.css` with `jp-go-dds.core/ext-css`. This
  namespace only requires `jp-go-dds.core`; the browser bundle does not need
  `jp-go-dds.page` or `html.core` at runtime."
